<h2 align="left">Heya! I'm Leonie :)</h2>

###

I'm a self-taught, 22 years old Software Engineer with about 14 years of experience. I currently work as a Product Owner in real life and enjoy working on personal projects, such as developing Roblox games, in my free time. I love learning new things, and involving myself in topics that seem fun and pique my interest. :)

In addition to coding, I love playing games, such as shooters, souls-likes, VRChat and essentially anything I get invited to. I also enjoy going on hikes through forests to relax myself in the calm nature.
