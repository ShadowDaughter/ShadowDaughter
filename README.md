## Heya, I'm Leonie!
I'm a self-taught 23-year-old Software Engineer with about 14 years of experience. I work as a Product Owner in real life and enjoy working on personal projects, such as developing Roblox games, in my free time. I love learning new things and involving myself in topics that seem fun and pique my interest.

In addition to coding, I love playing games, such as shooters, souls-likes, VRChat, and anything I get invited to. I also enjoy going on hikes through forests and lakes to relax in the calm nature.
